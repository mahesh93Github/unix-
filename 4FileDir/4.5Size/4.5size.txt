Q4.5 : we said that the file size 0 is valid for regular file. we also said that the st_size field is define for directory and symbolic link.
	should we ever see the file size 0 for directory and symbolic link ?
--> No , bcoz in case of symbolic link the size is depend on the number of byte in filename on which symbolic link is point.(and we need minimum 1 char to create filename if symbolic link to that file make minmum of 1byte size)

 in case of directory ,directory cantains array of filename and inode number,when the diectory is created then that time OS allocate 1 inode to that directory ,that inode points to minimum 1 block so that we see the directory size in terms 1 block,it is minimum size allocation for storing meta data about file contain in that directory along with name.
