1.create 1 static library with function defination and 1 header file with function prototype
	staticLib.c ,staticLib.h
		
2. create 1 user program include header file of staticlib init and use function
	userProgram.c
	 
3. complie and create object file of static library and user program
	staticLib.o ,userProgram.o

4.create archive/static library of staticlib file
	$ ar rcs libmy.a staticLib.o
 		ar-> create modify and extract from archive
		rcs-> r ->insert file member into archive file
		      c->create archive
		      s->write an object file index into archive file or update exiting one

5.link that lib.a to our program.o and create executable  and run that executable file
	$ gcc -o userPro userPro.o -L ./ -lmy
		-o ->place output in file (here userPro)
		-L ->directory search with that you specified with -L
		-l -> search the library name when linking
		./ -> specify search from this path
