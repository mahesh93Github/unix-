1.create 1 sharedLib program file with header file program file contains function defination and header file contains prototype
2.create l userprogram file to use shared library in that file 
3.compile all shared file using below cmd
	gcc -fpic -c sharedfile.c
		-fpic -> in generate Position Independant Code sutaible for dynamic linking, PIC con be executed at any address without modification.
	gcc -shared -o libmylib.so sharedfile.o
		-shared-> this create shared object which can then linke to other object to form executable
		-o -> make output file 
4.compile user program and generat output file
	gcc -c userpro.c -o userpro.o
5.link shared library to program file using 
	gcc -o userpro userpro.o -L ./ -imylib
		-L ->is user for searching special linker files
